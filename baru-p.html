                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This EVCS is our first project. It has been filled with struggles and tears. Through this EVCS, we have discovered the true mindset of an engineer. We express our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Agus Mukhlisin S.T.,M.T for teaching us to strive and never give up.
                    <br>Even though our knowledge was minimal at that time, we remained enthusiastic because we knew that extraordinary results require a challenging process. Since the beginning of this project, we kept on learning and learning to develop our hardware, firmware, and software skills. Our orientation shifted from just being university students to become experts in our concentration. We love discussing our area of expertise anywhere and anytime. This EVCS is a tangible proof of our struggle, and we believe it will lead us to become great engineers in the future.</p>
